# Node Disks

An abstraction for local/remote disks for node inspired by The League of Extraordinary Packages's
FlySystem.

## Prerequisites

-   Node >= 10.10 (requires support for `withFileTypes` in `fs.readdir`)

## Getting Started

Install the package in your project:

```
yarn add @carimus/node-disks
```

Or if you're using `npm`:

```
npm install --save @carimus/node-disks
```

## Usage

TODO

## TODO

-   [ ] Tests
-   [ ] Docs (for now check out the well documented source code)
-   [ ] Don't rely on `fs.readdir`'s `withFileTypes` so as to support all node 10 versions
